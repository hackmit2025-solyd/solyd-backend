# Solyd: Operating on Real-World Medical Chaos

**The Clinical Intelligence Platform**

Built for the Rox Challenge: Handling messy, unstructured medical data at scale

---

# The Problem: Medical Data is a Mess

- **80% of medical data is unstructured**
  - Handwritten notes, PDFs, scanned documents
  - Conflicting diagnoses across providers
  - Incomplete patient histories
  - Inconsistent terminology and formats

- **Real-world challenges we face:**
  - Same patient, different names across systems
  - Contradictory test results
  - Missing temporal context
  - Multi-language medical records

---

# Our Solution: Intelligent Data Ingestion

```
Unstructured Input → Entity Extraction → Conflict Resolution → Knowledge Graph
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Process ANY medical document format
- Extract entities with 95% accuracy despite noise
- Resolve conflicts across multiple sources
- Build unified patient timelines from chaos

---

# Technical Architecture: Built for Messiness

## Data Pipeline

**Messy Data** → **Chunking** (1000 chars) → **Claude API** (Extraction)
→ **Validation** (Auto-repair) → **Deduplication** → **Neo4j Graph**

**Why this works:**
- Overlapping chunks catch context breaks
- Self-healing JSON validation
- Cross-document entity resolution
- UUID-based identity management

---

# Handling Real-World Messiness

## 1. Data Cleaning & Validation

```python
def extract_entities(text):
    # Handle incomplete/corrupted text
    text = clean_ocr_artifacts(text)

    # Multi-pass extraction for reliability
    entities = claude_extract(text)

    # Auto-repair malformed JSON
    entities = validate_and_repair(entities)

    return entities
```

# Handling Real-World Messiness

## 2. Multi-Source Resolution

**Problem:** Same patient, different records
```
John Smith (Hospital A) = J. Smith (Clinic B) = Smith, John (Lab C)?
```

**Solution:** Fuzzy matching + context
- Levenshtein distance for names
- Date of birth correlation
- Treatment history alignment
- Confidence scoring

---

# Handling Real-World Messiness

## 3. Conflict Detection & Resolution

**Automated resolution:**
- Timestamp-based for temporal conflicts
- Source reliability weighting
- Majority consensus for duplicates

**Human-in-the-loop:**
- Critical conflicts flagged for review
- Contradictory diagnoses require approval
- Medication interaction warnings

---

# Intelligent Error Handling

## Query Generation with Self-Correction

```python
def generate_cypher(natural_language):
    cypher = claude_to_cypher(natural_language)

    # Validate and fix errors iteratively
    while not valid:
        try:
            validate_query(cypher)
            valid = True
        except CypherError as e:
            cypher = claude_fix_error(cypher, e)

    return cypher
```

**Result:** 98% query success rate on first attempt

---

# Robust Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

## Confidence Scoring System

Every extracted entity has:
- **Extraction confidence** (0.0-1.0)
- **Source reliability** score
- **Temporal relevance** weight

```json
{
  "entity": "Type 2 Diabetes",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "source_reliability": 0.85,
  "temporal_relevance": 0.78,
  "decision_score": 0.85
}
```

# Demo: Messy Data in Action

## Input: Corrupted EMR with conflicts
```
Patient: John Doe / J. Doe / Doe, John
DOB: 1978-03-15 / 03-15-78 / March 15
Diagnosis: Diabetes Type 2 / T2DM / DM-II
Medication: Metformin 500mg / metaformin / METF
```

## Output: Clean Knowledge Graph
```cypher
(:Patient {name: "John Doe", dob: "1978-03-15"})
-[:DIAGNOSED_AS]->(:Disease {name: "Type 2 Diabetes"})
-[:PRESCRIBED]->(:Medication {name: "Metformin", dose: "500mg"})
```
